/**
 * The environment's state: the two cheap facts the top bar's chip shows, and the doctor's rows.
 *
 * The facts are read from the filesystem, so they are read again whenever the screen comes back and whenever
 * the player changed one of them (the environment was prepared, the keys were replaced). The doctor runs a
 * python inside the rootfs - seconds, not milliseconds - so it only runs when the player asks for it, and its
 * rows stay until the next run.
 *
 * Android's limit on the app's child processes is a third fact: reading it runs a program, so it is read on
 * a thread of its own and lands here when it is there.
