You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with
this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

The license text itself is [LICENSE](LICENSE). This file says what those terms
cover, who holds the copyright on what, and which parts keep a license of their
own.

## What this covers

The code this repository owns and maintains — the porter (`porter/`), the
desktop GUI (`gui/`), the phone app (`android/`), the packaging scripts
(`packaging/`), the documentation (`docs/`, `README.md`) and the vendored
upstream engine tree (`nxnative/`) — is under those terms.

Parts of the tree are written by others and are NOT covered by them. They keep
the license file in their own directory, and
[THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) lists all of them:

| Path | License | License file |
|---|---|---|
| `nxnative/dm/android/lsfg/` | GPL-3.0-or-later (from Eden / lsfg-vk) | [`nxnative/dm/android/lsfg/LICENSE.md`](nxnative/dm/android/lsfg/LICENSE.md), full text in `nxnative/dm/android/lsfg/COPYING` |
| `nxnative/dm/third_party/*` | each its own (MIT, BSD, Apache-2.0, zlib) | in each directory, listed in [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) |
| `nxnative/dm/gfx/tools/dmsh_xlate_bin/` | the prebuilt binaries carry the licenses of the components they are built from | [`nxnative/dm/gfx/tools/dmsh_xlate_bin/NOTICE.md`](nxnative/dm/gfx/tools/dmsh_xlate_bin/NOTICE.md) |

Every binary built from this repository — the phone APK, the desktop zip, the
host and the per-game APK — is distributed under GPL-3.0-or-later. The frame
generation can be left out of a build, but that does not change the license of
the code the build came from. What that means for the app is in
[android/NOTICE.md](android/NOTICE.md).

## The upstream code this repository continues

Two upstreams are vendored here, and both were MIT licensed:

- **the engine tree under `nxnative/`** — from
  [seedds/nxnative](https://github.com/seedds/nxnative), which ships an MIT
  license file.
- **the desktop tool the porter and the GUI continue** — from
  [shirai91/nx2android](https://github.com/shirai91/nx2android), whose README
  states "MIT, as nxnative". That repository ships no license file, so the MIT
  text is quoted for it here too.

Both are relicensed here as GPL-3.0-or-later under the sublicense clause of the
MIT license they carried ("to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute,
sublicense, and/or sell copies"), with their copyright notices kept. The MIT
text is reproduced in full at the end of this file.

## Game files and trademarks

This repository contains no game files, no keys, no firmware and nothing
extracted from them, and the tool never downloads any of those. The game
profiles hold interoperation metadata only (shader key hashes, offsets inside
a module and small patch stubs), which the README explains in full.

Nintendo Switch, the game names and the trademarks and game artwork shown in
this repository identify the games this tool is compatible with. They belong to
Nintendo and to the respective publishers and developers. This project is not
affiliated with or endorsed by them.
