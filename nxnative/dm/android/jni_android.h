// Android port: the second front end's contract (the app's :play process, jni_android.c). front_player.c
// serves the code-less NativeActivity APK (the PC flow) and the app's player alike: one shared core (window,
// input, lifecycle, settings, the host's start), two entries. The NativeActivity's callbacks feed it as always;
// the player's plain Activity has no AInputQueue, so Java hands over raw events through this shape instead —
// a key event, or a motion snapshot (every pointer's place, as AMotionEvent would report it). No AInputEvent
// crosses this line: the NativeActivity path unpacks its queue's event into a dm_java_event
// (java_event_from_input, front_player.c) so both entries drive identical handlers.
